label='MY LABEL 2'] for each time you use the plugin

 Q: Why do you require me to sign up?
A: Signing up is what allows us to track which plugins are yours, and allows
you to edit them right in your page.

 Q: Will my users see the settings icon in the corner of the Count Up Timer?

typing 'p + up-arrow'.
